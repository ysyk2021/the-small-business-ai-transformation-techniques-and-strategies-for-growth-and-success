Step 3: Develop an Implementation Plan
--------------------------------------

The third step in selecting AI tools and implementing them into workflows is to develop an implementation plan. This involves identifying the workflow process and determining how the AI tool will be integrated into that process.

Some questions to consider during this stage include:

* What is the workflow process that the AI tool will be integrated into?
* What are the specific steps involved in integrating the AI tool into the workflow process?
* Who will be responsible for implementing and managing the AI tool in the workflow process?

Step 4: Train Employees and Monitor Use
---------------------------------------

The final step in selecting AI tools and implementing them into workflows is to train employees on the use of the AI tool and monitor its use. This involves providing training and support to employees to ensure successful adoption and use of the AI tool and monitoring its impact on business performance.

Some questions to consider during this stage include:

* What is the training plan for employees to use the AI tool?
* How will we monitor adoption and use of the AI tool?
* How will we measure the impact of the AI tool on business performance?
