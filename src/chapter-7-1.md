While the benefits of AI technology are numerous, there are also tradeoffs involved in AI-enhanced small business transformation. These tradeoffs include:

The cost of implementing AI technology can be significant, particularly for small businesses with limited resources. Small businesses must carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of AI adoption to ensure that it is financially feasible.

### Data Privacy and Security
