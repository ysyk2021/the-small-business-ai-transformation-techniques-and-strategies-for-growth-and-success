* What are the most time-consuming or labor-intensive processes?
* Where can AI technology make the most significant impact?

Step 2: Evaluate Workflow Processes
-----------------------------------

The second step in identifying small business processes that can be transformed with AI is to evaluate workflow processes. This involves analyzing the specific steps involved in each business process and determining how AI technology can improve those steps.

Some questions to consider during this stage include:

* What are the specific steps involved in each business process?
* Where are the bottlenecks or inefficiencies in each process?
* How can AI technology improve those steps?

Step 3: Match AI Technologies to Business Needs
